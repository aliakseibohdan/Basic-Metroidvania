  paragraphs:
  - I am thy father's spirit, doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, and for
    the day confined to fast in fires, till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    are burnt and purged away.
  - But that I am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison-house, I could a tale unfold
    whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, make thy
    two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, thy knotted and combined locks
    to part...
  - If thou didst ever thy dear father love --
  - Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
